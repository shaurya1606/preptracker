# Backend Track API System Design Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive, detailed explanation of the architecture, folder structure, code hierarchy, and call flow for the Track API service in the backend of the PrepTracker project. It is designed to serve as a reference for developers and system designers, and as a template for documenting future backend and frontend services.

## 1. Project Structure & Modularity

The backend codebase is organized using a modular, layered architecture. Each folder and file has a specific responsibility, making the codebase scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend.

```
backend/
│
├── src/
│   ├── app.ts                # Main entry point, Express app setup
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── Database.ts       # Database connection and initialization logic
│   ├── controller/
│   │   └── TrackController.ts# Handles HTTP requests for Track resource
│   ├── model/
│   │   └── TrackModel.ts     # TypeORM entity for Track table
│   ├── repository/
│   │   └── TrackRepository.ts# Data access logic for Track
│   ├── routes/
│   │   └── TrackRoutes.ts    # Express router for Track endpoints
│   ├── service/
│   │   └── TrackService.ts   # Business logic for Track
│   └── ...                   # Other modules/services
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

### Modularity Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer (model, repository, service, controller, routes, config) is responsible for a distinct part of the application logic.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each file/class does one thing (e.g., `TrackRepository` only handles DB operations for Track).
- **Extensibility:** New features or entities can be added by replicating the structure.

## 2. Track API Call Flow & Data Lifecycle

### 2.1. End-to-End Request Flow

1. **Client** sends a request to `/api/v1/tracks` (GET or POST).
2. **Express App (`app.ts`)** receives the request and delegates to the router (`TrackRoutes.ts`).
3. **Router (`TrackRoutes.ts`)** matches the endpoint and calls the appropriate controller function (`createTrack` for POST, etc.).
4. **Controller (`TrackController.ts`)** processes the request, validates input, and calls the service layer.
5. **Service (`TrackService.ts`)** contains business logic and calls the repository for data access.
6. **Repository (`TrackRepository.ts`)** interacts with the database using TypeORM, performing CRUD operations.
7. **Model (`TrackModel.ts`)** defines the Track entity and its schema for the database.
8. **Database (`Database.ts`)** manages the connection to PostgreSQL and entity synchronization.

### 2.2. Example: POST /api/v1/tracks

    Client -->|POST /api/v1/tracks| ExpressApp
    ExpressApp -->|routes to| TrackRoutes
    TrackRoutes -->|calls| TrackController
    TrackController -->|calls| TrackService
    TrackService -->|calls| TrackRepository
    TrackRepository -->|uses| TrackModel
    TrackRepository -->|DB ops| Database
    Database -->|PostgreSQL| TrackTable
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
| Step | File/Component         | Action/Responsibility                          |
|------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1    | app.ts                | Receives POST request, routes to TrackRoutes  |
| 2    | TrackRoutes.ts        | Calls createTrack controller                  |
| 3    | TrackController.ts    | Extracts data, calls TrackService             |
| 4    | TrackService.ts       | Validates, calls TrackRepository              |
| 5    | TrackRepository.ts    | Creates and saves Track entity                |
| 6    | TrackModel.ts         | Entity definition for Track                   |
| 7    | Database.ts           | Handles DB connection and sync                |

## 3. Detailed Component Roles & Responsibilities

### app.ts
- Sets up the Express server and middleware (e.g., JSON parsing).
- Mounts `/api/v1` routes for Track and other future services.
- Responsible for initializing the database connection (via `initializeDatabase`).
- Can be extended to add global error handling, authentication, logging, etc.

### config/Database.ts
- Configures TypeORM DataSource for PostgreSQL.
- Exports `initializeDatabase()` to connect and synchronize entities.
- Ensures all models are registered for automatic table creation.

### routes/TrackRoutes.ts
- Defines endpoints for Track resource (`/tracks`).
- Maps HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to controller functions.
- Can be extended to add more routes (PUT, DELETE, etc.).

### controller/TrackController.ts
- Handles HTTP requests and responses for Track.
- Validates and extracts request data.
- Calls service methods and returns appropriate HTTP responses.
- Can be extended to add input validation, error handling, etc.

### service/TrackService.ts
- Contains business logic for Track operations (e.g., validation, transformation).
- Calls repository for data access.
- Can be extended to add more complex business rules.

### repository/TrackRepository.ts
- Handles direct database operations (CRUD) for Track.
- Uses TypeORM repository for Track entity.
- Can be extended to add custom queries, batch operations, etc.

### model/TrackModel.ts
- Defines Track entity schema (fields, types, decorators).
- Used by TypeORM to map to the database table.
- Can be extended to add more fields, relationships, etc.

## 4. Track Entity Table Structure

| Field       | Type      | Description                |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------------|
| id          | uuid      | Primary key                |
| name        | varchar   | Track name (required)      |
| description | varchar   | Track description          |
| slug        | varchar   | URL-friendly identifier    |
| isNew       | boolean   | Is this a new track?       |
| isActive    | boolean   | Is this track active?      |
| createdAt   | date      | Creation timestamp         |

## 5. System Design Principles & Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer (controller, service, repository, model) has a clear responsibility.
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new features (e.g., more endpoints, new entities, authentication).
- **Maintainability:** Modular code makes debugging and updates straightforward.
- **Type Safety:** TypeScript and TypeORM ensure strong typing and schema validation.
- **Extensibility:** New backend services and frontend models can follow the same structure for consistency.
- **Error Handling:** Can be centralized in `app.ts` for all routes and services.
- **Documentation:** Each service/module should have its own design doc in the `System Design` folder.

```
Arrows indicate the direction of function calls and data flow.

## 7. Template for Future Services

- Create a new folder for each backend service or frontend model.
- Document the structure, call flow, and responsibilities in a markdown file in the `System Design` folder.
- Use diagrams, tables, and step-by-step explanations for clarity.

## 8. Summary

This document serves as the first system design for the backend Track API. Future backend services and frontend models should follow this modular, well-documented approach for consistency and maintainability.
